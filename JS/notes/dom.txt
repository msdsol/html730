DOcument object Model:
Browser provides an object 'document' which contains complete html in it
we can access,modify or even create html elements using document object.
  i. access/select elements(DOM selection):
  ii. modify elements(DOM Manipulation):
  iii. create elements(DOM creation)

DOM selection: IN Js, using document object we can select elements in 5 mostly used ways:
  i. getElementsByTagName: it is used to select all elements with a particular tag name and results an array
  Eg: document.getElementsByTagName('h1')
  ii. getElementsByClassName: it is used to select all elements with a particular class name and results an array
  document.getElementsByClassName("classname")
  iii. getElementById: it is used to select particular element with id and results single element.
  iv. querySelector: it is used to select an element similar to css query but it will select only first element
  v. querySelectorAll: it is used to select all elements with certain query and results an array
